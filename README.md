Railway Logistics Simulation

This console application simulates a railway logistics system, providing a realistic representation of train operations. It leverages object-oriented programming principles, including inheritance, abstract classes, and interfaces, to create a modular and extensible codebase.

Features

Inheritance: Different classes of railroad cars are implemented using inheritance, allowing for code reuse and defining common attributes and behaviors in a base class.
Abstract Classes: Abstract classes are used to establish a contract and provide a common interface for derived classes representing specific types of railroad cars. This ensures consistency and enforces the implementation of core functionalities.
Interfaces: Interfaces define a set of behaviors that certain classes must exhibit. They enable standardized interactions between different components of the system and promote modularity.
Thread-based Simulation: Trains are represented as threads within the application, providing real-time movement and operations. Thread synchronization ensures coordinated execution and prevents conflicts in the railway system.
